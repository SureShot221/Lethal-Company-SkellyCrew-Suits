# Lethal-Company-SkellyCrew-Suits
This is a mod that adds a variaty of Skeleton suit variations from the More_Suits (By x753), as a side note the More_Suits & BepInEx mods also need to be installed for the mods to work.

..Currently testing the mod to work off of mod managers, hence the multiple reuploads..

Alternatively, if you download the file manually off of the thunderstore web browser, then manually add the mod to the BepInEx/Plugins folder, the mod will work..
